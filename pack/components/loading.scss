// Loading
// After the DOM content has loaded, our companion script will add an attr to the <html> element.
// This way, our CSS can hook into that event and change display (eg: hiding/unhiding stuff) as necessary.

html:not([dom-content-loaded]) [hide-loading] {
  display: none!important; // Or visibility: hidden ??
}
